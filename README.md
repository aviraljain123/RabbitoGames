# RabbitoGames
This is the game that my team is making to improve the ways assessment are currently conducted for children. This game focuses on MCQ based tests.

We have made code for a basic GK testing and the options are made in such a way that we have to hit the block from below and collect the carrot to choose the option. In case the wrong option is chosen, we just need to hit the box again to unchoose the option. 

To play the game, game is hosted on the site https://rabbitogames.netlify.app/ or another way to run the game is to download the code from github as ZIP file, the extract it and then opening the extracted folder, after which opening the index.html with browser of your choice will open the game. 

The full site is hosted at https://avijaiaj335.wixsite.com/rabbitoedugames.

Hope you enjoy the game and the concept behind it!
